The project is a simple website done only in HTML. On the site there are three recipes for yummy eatings. 
This project uses links, lists, images and text elements and a little wit. It is meant to demonstate that I am able to use basic HTML.
Since it was used with GIT and CLI I also learned some basic Git commands and how version control works.
